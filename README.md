Basic game loop: one level. aim is to kill all the slug monsters with bullets. there is a pickup along the way that gives you a rocket which has a splash damage. if you get hit by a slug you die and respawn at the start. enemies dont respawn when you respawn. 

due to time constraints on myself (ryan) i was unable to get as much done as i wanted. the original plan was for more attack types, and for them to combo with eachother. this was influenced by the game magicka. 

controls: 
1. a/d: movement
2. lclick: primary fire
3. rclick: alt fire
4. space: jump

the most technically challenging part of the prototype is the jumping mechanics. quite often the player will be able to hover off of ledges instead of falling down.
