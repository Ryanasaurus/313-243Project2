# slug fest

Basic game loop: one level. aim is to kill all the slug monsters with bullets. there is a pickup along the way that gives you a rocket which has a splash damage. 
if you get hit by a slug you die and respawn at the start. enemies dont respawn when you respawn. there is no win condition coded into the game currently. 

due to time constraints on myself (ryan) i was unable to get as much done as i wanted. the original plan was for more attack types, and for them to combo with eachother. 
this was influenced by the game magicka. There was also plans to include multiple enemy types, along with them being resistant to certain types of attacks.

controls: 
1. a/d: movement
2. lclick: primary fire
3. rclick: alt fire
4. space: jump

the most technically challenging part of the prototype is the jumping mechanics. quite often the player will be able to hover off of ledges instead of falling down. 
I found this, and the collisions to be the most tricky part of the game to make. The bullets/rockets dont collide with the enemies well, and was hard to get them to the 
stage that they are in. The bullets dont currently despawn when hitting an enemy, which i attempted to fix, but ran out of time to do so. 

the built games are stored inside the Builds folder.
